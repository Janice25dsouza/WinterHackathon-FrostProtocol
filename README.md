#  Intent Based Fund Flow using Blockchain

## Description
This is a blockchain-based, intent-driven fund management system designed to improve transparency, accountability, and efficiency in government fund allocation and disbursement.

In traditional government budgeting systems, funds allocated for a specific purpose can be misused after transfer due to a lack of enforceable intent. We solve this problem with the *intent* of funds on-chain and enforcing hierarchical validation across multiple government levels — from central authority to schemes and finally beneficiaries.

The platform is built for government authorities, scheme administrators, auditors, and beneficiaries to ensure that public funds are used **only for their approved purposes**, with full traceability and auditability.

## Features
- **Intent-Based Fund Allocation** – Funds are issued with a purpose that cannot be violated

- **Blockchain Transparency & Auditability** – All fund movements are recorded immutably on chain
- **Role-Based Dashboards** – Separate dashboards for Central Authority, Schemes, and Beneficiaries
- **Tamper-Proof Fund Usage** – Funds cannot be spent outside their approved intent
